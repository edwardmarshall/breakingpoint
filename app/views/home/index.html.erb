					<h2>Breaking Point 1 Recap</h2>
					<h4>Ford 6.7L, a new level of respect</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="section-body">
					<p>The first Breaking Point was completely jaw-dropping. We took a stock Ford 6.7L Scorpion engine, bolted on a few parts from
					<a href="http://www.hs-motorsports.com">H&amp;S Motorsports</a>, and hit 884 horsepower before the transmission slipped.</p>

				<div class="section-body">
					<p>Now that we have a better idea of what the Scorpion is capable of, it's time to move on and give the GM crowd
					some love. We've seen a lot of posts on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hsperformance?fref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page and heard <a href="http://www.hsperformance.com/1/" target="_blank">endless chatter</a> about the LML far out-performing
					the Scorpion. Is all the talk legit? I guess we'll see. We don't really care who 'wins', we just need to see what the Duramax can do.</p>

			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<h4>You might be wondering the same things.</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="section-body">
			<ul class="questions">
				<li>Will you ever test the Ford again?<br /><span>Yes. First we need a transmission that can handle additional power. As soon as we have the new tranny finished, the Ford will be ready for round two.</span></li>
				<li>Will the video feed be higher quality?<br /><span>Yes. Multiple camera angles all streaming in HD.</span></li>
				<li>Will I be able to hear the voices better?<br /><span>Yes. We've purchased the highest quality sound equipment we could find.</span></li>
				<li>Where can I find the specs of the truck?<br /><span>Get a VIP pass and we'll take you on a step-by-step tour through the build of the Duramax.</span></li>
				<li>What if I can't watch it live?<br /><span>Honestly, kind of a bummer. But yes, we'll have it all recorded online so you can watch it any time.</span></li>
				<li>How come you do multiple runs instead of just running it until it explodes?<br /><span>The goal is to see how much horsepower the engine will hold. To do this, we step up the power gradually so we know precisely at what point the engine fails. If we just wanted to watch it blow up we'd put it out in the parking lot with a stick of dynamite.</span></li>
